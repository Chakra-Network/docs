## Using Jupyter with Chakra

You can connect Jupyter notebooks to your Chakra database using the standard Python client. Here's a quick example:

```python
from chakra_py import Chakra
import pandas as pd

# Initialize client
client = Chakra("YOUR_DB_SESSION_KEY")

# Query your data
df = client.execute("SELECT * FROM table_name")

# Use pandas, matplotlib, or other visualization libraries
df.plot()
```

## Consider Using Marimo

While Jupyter notebooks are widely used, we recommend trying [Marimo](https://marimo.io/dashboard/projects) - a modern Python notebook that addresses many of Jupyter's limitations. Marimo offers:

- Real-time reactivity
- Better version control compatibility
- Cleaner code organization
- Enhanced reproducibility
- Native UI components

Check out this [example Marimo notebook](https://marimo.io/p/@chakra/notebook-6l2uh5) that demonstrates how to analyze and visualize Chakra data effectively.

Marimo's reactive execution model ensures your analysis stays up-to-date as you modify your code, making it ideal for exploratory data analysis with Chakra.
