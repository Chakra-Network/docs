# Looker Studio Connector

<Note type="warning">
  This connector is currently in development and requires approval for access. Please contact us via [Discord](https://discord.gg/chakra-ai) or email at hi@chakra-labs.com to request access.
</Note>

Chakra's Looker Studio connector allows you to create powerful visualizations and dashboards using your warehouse data directly in Google's Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio).

## Why Use the Connector?

- **Zero Data Export** - Query your data directly without exporting CSV files
- **Real-time Dashboards** - Create live dashboards that refresh automatically
- **Powerful Visualizations** - Leverage Looker Studio's extensive chart library
- **Secure Access** - Uses your Chakra credentials for secure data access
- **Simple Setup** - Connect in minutes with minimal configuration

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title='Create a Looker Studio Account'>
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a free account at [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title='Create a New Data Source'>
    In Looker Studio, click on "Create" and then select "Data Source". Scroll down to the bottom and select "Build your own connector".
    
    Enter the following Deployment ID in the provided field:
    
    ```
    AKfycbyCvuGqvABcfe46rvgGfCTDzbJuORX14LQcVkx1CHy4LPSEr9TNWTQ5EtIN_guUuACBpw
    ```
    
    <Note>
      Access to this connector is limited during the development phase. If you encounter an access error, please contact our team to be added to the approved users list.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title='Configure the Connection'>
    You'll need your Chakra DB Session Key, which can be found in the [settings page](https://console.chakra.dev/settings). The key format is:
    
    ```
    access:secret:username
    ```
    
    Enter this key in the DB Session Key field.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title='Enter Your SQL Query'>
    Enter the SQL query you want to use for your dashboard. For example:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM duckdb.main.unicorn
    ```
    
    <Note>
      If you're unsure what tables are available, you can first explore your data in the [Worksheets](https://console.chakra.dev/worksheet) section.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title='Create Your Report'>
    Once connected, you can create visualizations using your Chakra data. Looker Studio will automatically detect field types and suggest appropriate visualizations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

### Field Type Handling

The connector automatically detects field types based on your data:

| Data Type | Looker Studio Type | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| Numeric values | NUMBER | Automatically set as metrics |
| Strings | TEXT | Set as dimensions |
| Date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) | YEAR_MONTH_DAY | Properly formatted for time series |
| Timestamps | YEAR_MONTH_DAY_SECOND | Full datetime support |
| Booleans | BOOLEAN | Supports true/false filtering |

### SQL Query Tips

For optimal performance with the connector:

- **Add LIMIT Clauses** - For large datasets, add a LIMIT clause to your query
- **Use Aggregations** - Pre-aggregate data when possible using GROUP BY
- **Optimize Joins** - Keep joins simple for better performance
- **Use WHERE Clauses** - Filter data in your SQL rather than in Looker Studio

Example optimized query:

```sql
SELECT 
  date_trunc('month', created_at) as month,
  category,
  SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM sales
WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 5000
```

### Using Filters

The connector supports Looker Studio's filter controls. You can add filter widgets to your dashboard that will dynamically modify your SQL query.

<Note>
  For optimal performance, only use filters on dimensions (not metrics) and limit the number of filter controls to 3-5 per dashboard.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Double-check your DB Session Key format (access:secret:username) |
| "Query failed" | Verify your SQL syntax and table names |
| "No data returned" | Check that your query returns data in the Worksheets section |
| Date formatting issues | Ensure dates are in standard ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| Slow performance | Add LIMIT clauses and optimize your query |

### Rate Limits

The connector respects Chakra's API rate limits. For dashboards with many charts or frequent refreshes, consider:

- Using more efficient queries
- Reducing auto-refresh frequency
- Pre-aggregating data
