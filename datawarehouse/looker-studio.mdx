Chakra's Looker Studio connector allows you to create powerful visualizations and dashboards using your warehouse data directly in Google's Looker Studio (formerly Data Studio).

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title='Create a Looker Studio Account'>
    If you don't already have one, sign up for a free account at [Looker
    Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/)
  </Step>
<Step title='Create a New Data Source'>
  In Looker Studio, click on "Create" and then select "Data Source". Scroll down
  to the bottom and select "Build your own connector". Enter the following
  Deployment ID in the provided field: ```
  AKfycbyCvuGqvABcfe46rvgGfCTDzbJuORX14LQcVkx1CHy4LPSEr9TNWTQ5EtIN_guUuACBpw ```
</Step>

<Step title='Configure the Connection'>
  You'll need your Chakra DB Session Key, which can be found in the [settings
  page](https://console.chakra.dev/settings).
</Step>

<Step title='Enter Your SQL Query'>
  Enter the SQL query you want to use for your dashboard. For example: ```
  SELECT * FROM duckdb.main.unicorn ```
</Step>

  <Step title='Create Your Report'>
    Once connected, you can create visualizations using your Chakra data. Looker
    Studio will automatically detect field types and suggest appropriate
    visualizations.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Configuration

### Field Type Handling

The connector automatically detects field types based on your data:

| Data Type                 | Looker Studio Type    | Notes                              |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Numeric values            | NUMBER                | Automatically set as metrics       |
| Strings                   | TEXT                  | Set as dimensions                  |
| Date strings (YYYY-MM-DD) | YEAR_MONTH_DAY        | Properly formatted for time series |
| Timestamps                | YEAR_MONTH_DAY_SECOND | Full datetime support              |
| Booleans                  | BOOLEAN               | Supports true/false filtering      |

### SQL Query Tips

For optimal performance with the connector:

- **Add LIMIT Clauses** - For large datasets, add a LIMIT clause to your query
- **Use Aggregations** - Pre-aggregate data when possible using GROUP BY
- **Optimize Joins** - Keep joins simple for better performance
- **Use WHERE Clauses** - Filter data in your SQL rather than in Looker Studio

Example optimized query:

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('month', created_at) as month,
  category,
  SUM(revenue) as total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM sales
WHERE created_at > '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
LIMIT 5000
```

### Using Filters

The connector supports Looker Studio's filter controls. You can add filter widgets to your dashboard that will dynamically modify your SQL query.

<Note>
  For optimal performance, only use filters on dimensions (not metrics) and
  limit the number of filter controls to 3-5 per dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue                  | Solution                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Authentication failed  | Double-check your DB Session Key format                      |
| Query failed           | Verify your SQL syntax and table names                       |
| No data returned       | Check that your query returns data in the Worksheets section |
| Date formatting issues | Ensure dates are in standard ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)         |
| Slow performance       | Add LIMIT clauses and optimize your query                    |
