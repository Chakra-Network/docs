Chakra uses a simple, streamlined organization model where each user belongs to exactly one organization. This helps keep your data and resources organized while maintaining simplicity.

# User Authentication

Users can join Chakra through:

- Google SSO
- Email/Password
- GitHub

# Organization Setup

When a user first signs up, they can either:

1. Create a new organization
2. Join an existing organization (requires invitation)

<Note>
  Users can only belong to one organization at a time. If you need to switch
  organizations, you'll need to [contact us](https://discord.gg/chakra-ai) to
  migrate your account for now.
</Note>

Currently, organizations are automatically created based on Google SSO. If you need help joining or migrating orgs, do reach [out](https://discord.gg/chakra-ai).

# Roles and Permissions

Chakra currently supports two roles to keep things simple:

## Admin Role

- Manage users (invite/remove)
- Change user roles
- Access all organization resources
- Full access to databases, integrations, and worksheets

## Member Role

- Access all organization resources
- Full access to databases, integrations, and worksheets

# Future Enhancements

While we're starting with a straightforward permissions model, we're planning to add:

- More granular resource-level permissions
- Custom roles
- Project-based access controls
- Advanced audit logging
