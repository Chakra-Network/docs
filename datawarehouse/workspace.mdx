Chakra uses a simple, streamlined organization model where each user belongs to exactly one organization.
This helps keep your data and resources organized while maintaining simplicity.

You can find your organization page by navigating to [settings](https://console.chakra.dev/settings).

## User Authentication

Users can join Chakra through:

- Google SSO
- Email/Password
- GitHub

## Organization Setup

When a user first signs up, they can either:

1. Create a new organization
2. Join an existing organization (requires invitation)

<Note>
  Users can only belong to one organization at a time. If you need to switch
  organizations, you'll need to [contact us](https://discord.gg/chakra-ai) to
  migrate your account for now.
</Note>

Currently, organizations are automatically created based on Google SSO. If you need help joining or migrating orgs, do reach [out](https://discord.gg/chakra-ai).
