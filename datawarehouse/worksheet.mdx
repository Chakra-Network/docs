Worksheets are your home for interacting with your local, subscribed, and published databases.

## Loading Data

If you've got a pandas DataFrame, loading data into your ChakraDB is effortless. Check out the [Python SDK](https://github.com/Chakra-Network/python-sdk) for full documentation on how do so.

Your database session key can be found in the [settings page](https://console.chakra.dev/settings)

```python ingest.py
from chakra_py import Chakra
import pandas as pd

# Initialize client
client = Chakra("YOUR_DB_SESSION_KEY")

# Push data to a new or existing table
data = pd.DataFrame({
    "id": [1, 2, 3],
    "name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"],
    "score": [85.5, 92.0, 78.5]
})
client.push("students", data, create_if_missing=True)
```

## Query / Transform Data

Once your data is loaded, you'll be able to transform it using [DuckDB SQL](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction.html) directly in a worksheet.

Alternatively, you can run your SQL directly in a Python shell to retrieve your results programmatically.

```python transform.py
# Simple query
df = client.execute("SELECT * FROM table_name")

# Complex query with aggregations
df = client.execute(
  """
    SELECT
        category,
        COUNT(*) as count,
        AVG(value) as avg_value
    FROM measurements
    GROUP BY category
    HAVING count > 10
    ORDER BY avg_value DESC
""")

# Work with results using pandas
print(df.describe())
print(df.groupby('category').agg({'value': ['mean', 'std']}))
```
