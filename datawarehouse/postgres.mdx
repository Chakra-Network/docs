description: Query and join your existing PostgreSQL databases with DuckDB data.
---

## What You Can Do

- **Query** your Postgres tables directly from Chakra.
- **Join** Postgres data with DuckDB tables in a single query.
- **Analyze** and visualize combined data without manual exports or ETL.

> **Note:** No replication is required here. The Postgres tables are queried natively using [pg_duckdb](https://github.com/duckdb/pg_duckdb).

## Example Use Case

Suppose you have customer data in Postgres and product analytics in DuckDB. With Chakra, you can write a single SQL query to join these sources:

```sql
SELECT c.name, a.product_id, a.event_time
FROM postgres.customers c
JOIN duckdb.analytics a ON c.id = a.customer_id
WHERE a.event_time > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <b>Connect your Postgres database</b> in the [Chakra
    UI](https://console.chakra.dev/worksheet).

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add requisite details and confirm the database has been attached. You will
    see "blue" icons corresponding to Postgres attached databases.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Query and join the data like a normal DuckDB database.
