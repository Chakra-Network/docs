### What is Scout?

At Chakra, we're reimagining the web as a permissionless database. To that end, Scout - the decentralized indexing of the web - represents the final step in [our journey](/products).

With Scout, we capture public web traffic, allowing us to build datasets in the open data marketplace that fulfill key enterprise needs.
