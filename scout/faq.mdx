<Accordion title='What is Chakra?'>
  The **web, reimagined as a permissionless database**. <br />
  We capture public web traffic from our data scouts. This public traffic allows
  us to build datasets in the Open Data Marketplace that fulfill key enterprise needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why should I contribute?'>
  The web is open but extremely difficult for AI companies to navigate. It's
  cost prohibitive and technically challenging for these organizations to gather
  the data they need to run training and inference. <br />
  Chakra is building the **read layer for the internet**. We **organize** and **structure**
  this data, and you as the end contributor can earn standing on the leaderboard
  for capturing & organizing the world's structured data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Does Chakra collect any private data?'>
  **No** - Chakra never collects private data. <br />
  Chakra only collects public data and all permissions for data mapping can be configured
  explicitly in the setting page of the Extension. We undergo complete security audits
  and all data that is captured is anonymized and aggregated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='How do I get started?'>
  Download the [Extension](https://app.chakra.dev/) and browse the web as your
  normally do. Your "events collected" will start populating as your navigate
  supported websites.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='What are bits? What are events?'>
  Bits are rewards for mapping data. They are currently not live, but do stay
  tuned for updates on our [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/chakra_ai). <br />
  Events are unique pieces of data collected like a tweet or an individual profile.
  You can track your events collected on the [leaderboard](https://app.chakra.dev/).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why are my events not going up?'>
  To collect events, you must be navigating supported websites. <br /> Today,
  this only includes X / Twitter and LinkedIn, but over the coming months, we
  plan to support a variety of data assets.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='How can I access mapped data as an enterprise?'>
  Check out our [data marketetplace](/marketplace/introduction). All of the
  datasets collected by scouts are available for consumption in the data
  warehouse, Python SDK, and REST APIs.
