<Accordion title='What is Chakra?'>
  The Web as Database - we capture public web traffic from our data scouts. This
  public traffic allows us to build datasets in the Open Data Marketplace that
  fulfill key enterprise needs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why should I contribute?'>
  The web is open but extremely difficult for AI companies to navigate. It's
  cost prohibitive and technically challenging for these organizations to gather
  the data they need to run training and inference. Chakra organizes and
  structures this data, and you as the end contributor can earn standing on the
  leaderboard of the important mission of organizing the world's structured
  data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Does Chakra collect any private data?'>
  No. Chakra only collects public data and all permissions for data mapping can
  be configured explicitly in the setting page of the Chrome Extension. We
  undergo complete security audits and all data that is captured is anonymized
  and aggregated.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='How do I get started?'>
  Download the Extension and browse the web as your normally do. We use your
  bandwidth to collect data that would otherwise be difficult to procure - climb
  the leaderboard and earn rewards.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='How can I use mapped data as an enterprise?'>
  Check out our [data marketetplace](/marketplace/introduction). All of the
  datasets collected by mappers are available for consumption in the data
  warehouse, Python SDK, and REST APIs.
