## What is Pango?

Pango pays you to use your computer within supported applications.

AI agents that can actually **use** your computer - clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating spreadsheets - hit a wall in 2025.

These "computer use" agents promise to automate your digital work, but they're stuck at 40% success vs 70% human performance.

More compute â‰  better results when you're training on the same limited SFT (supervised fine-tuning) datasets.

The bottleneck is clear: we need more human workflow data.

Pango solves this by paying users for performing daily quests on their computer.
