The **profile_timeseries** table contains timeseries data for Twitter profile statistics:

| Column Name     | Description                                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |

| timestamp       | Timestamp when the profile stats snapshot was taken   |

| followers_count | Number of followers the user has at this time         |
| tweets_count    | Total number of tweets made by the user at this time  |

Each row represents a snapshot of a profile's statistics at a specific timestamp. The data is updated periodically at the same time as the profiles table and is ordered by timestamp for optimal query performance when using timestamp in query conditionals.
