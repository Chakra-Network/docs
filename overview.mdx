## Mission

Chakra is building the **Modular World Computer for Data**.

_We believe in a few things:_

1. There are **&lt;10 datasets in the world that drive the vast majority of value** towards traditional analytics and AI use-cases.
2. Most of these datasets sit in the hands of **users who ultimately provide all the value** but reap none of the rewards.
3. Enterprises building with AI need access to these key datasets and should have a simpler way **to procure and integrate** them into their workflows.

Chakra is on a mission to **provide the interface for the most important structured datasets in the world**.
