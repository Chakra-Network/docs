## What is Chakra Drive?

Chakra Drive is our first public product - a free end-to-end encrypted file storage solution built on Solana.
The project won 3rd place in the [Radar Hackathon](https://x.com/solana/status/1856355031374802958) and we're super excited to share this as a public good to our community.
